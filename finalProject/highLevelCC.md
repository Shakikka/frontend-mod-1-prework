Well I guess first I'd have to make an object where each letter is associated with a number, and that would have to include different numbers for caps. a-z would equate to 1-26, A-Z would equate 27-52.

Then I'd have to make some sort of encode method, and maybe a decode method, that would shift the letters the desired number of places in either direction, depending on which number is the input.
For the encode method, it would have to delete the old letter and replace it with the new letter, for the entire input.
I'm not really sure what else to do, or how to do it without googling it outright.
