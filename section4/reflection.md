## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

- My workflow was awful for this section, at least it was until I abandoned using the Pomodoro technique.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

- Setting intentions was fine. I like to-do lists, however I don't like how this entire process is supposed to be executed. I think the underlying premise of the Pomodoro technique is sound: work until you can't focus, then take a break, however the execution is horrendous! It's like the person that came up with this technique has no concept of flow states, and has an unhealthy obsession with control. 25 minutes is too little time to actually do anything, as is 5 minutes, so it's like you're trapped in a cycle of too little time to actually get anything done work wise and break wise. The process of making checkmarks and setting timers is unnecessary, and distracting. You're bound to get kicked out of a flow state when that timer goes off, and if you finish working early, you have to keep working even if you have no work? If you have to go to the bathroom you have to wait for the timer to go off? Completely ridiculous. This technique just isn't for me. I have no problem focusing, and I like to work until I'm done, or I'm at a good place to take a break. I like to ride the flow state if I'm in one, and having it disrupted by a timer and mandatory break is really a disservice. If my mind wanders, then it wanders, and I either reign it in or let it wonder until I'm ready to work again.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

- An object is a type of function, and it differs from an Array in the sense that it may contain much more data than just a numbered list of values. It can make use of arrays, however it is more like a database rich with information. Well as rich as you make it, at least.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class

    - I would use an array for this, as it is a straightforward list.

  * List of states and their capitals

    - I would use an object for this, as you want to pair data together.

  * List of things to pack for vacation

    - I would use an array for this, as it's just a list.

  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow

    - I would use an array for this because it is a simple list.

  * List of student names and their cohort

    - I would put this in an object, due to the pairing aspect.

  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake

    - I would definitely put this in an object, as you once again are pairing data.

  * All my favorite restaurants

    - Another simple list, so array.

1. In this section, we talked about a `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

- SEINet is an app where you can log where you find specific plant species, and it also lets you use dichotomous keys and GPS location to help you identify what kind of plant you have found down to species, using data of previously found plants in that area by participating herbariums and people. It is super rad!

LeafType could be an object within a dichotomous key, and these could be some of the leaf keys: leafShape (orbiculuar), leafForm (pinnate), venationPattern (reticulate), leafArrangement (alternate)... exciting stuff!



1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

  - Is it common to use stand alone objects, or does it just keep getting more complex from here, where everything is chained together and inside of larger blocks of code?
