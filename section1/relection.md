## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

- The SuperLearner article resonated with me well enough. I love to learn, and often times learn things just because. I used to do a great deal more of the things on the list that I hope to get back into, but I already am incredibly openminded, and I love to learn and apply my knowledge, and I am fond of taking breaks. I used to work out, and eat right, and read voraciously, and I would like to get back into all of that again. I would add a few things, like sleep, meditation, exercise, maybe supplements and probiotics. I'd also like to point out that a few of these things are false, or half truths. Reading is to your brain what exercise is to your body isn't exactly true...because exercise actually has a direct effect on your brain as well, so it's a bit more complex than that. Also the food guidelines to support brain health are a bit outdated. The microbiome of the digestive tract communicates with your brain, so anything you eat has an effect on your brain, and you do need saturated fat, and butter isn't bad for you. Seed oils, on the other hand are definitely bad for you. You don't necessarily need to eat fish, and since the oceans are dying...well you get the point. It was a good article overall.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

- Really? Again? Number: it is a number. Positive, negative, and decimal values are all acceptable. String: consists of letters, characters, and/or numbers encased in quotations. Boolean: a true or false statement.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

- console.log('Hello World!')

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

- // for single line or /**/ for multiple lines. A code comment is used to add context or extra information about your code to whoever reads it.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

- A variable allows a program to store a value, and reuse that value. I guess I would tell a 5yo that a variable is kind of like their name. Instead of saying "hey child" I am going to say "hey billy" every time I want to get your attention.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

- username, password, and email are all probably pretty common variables. They are all strings.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

- Concatenation is the ability to join together variables into a sentance, or some sort of string, using the + sign.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

- I can't think of a site or app, but I'm sure video games use them for inserting your chosen name into the game, especially in single player games.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

- I can't stop thinking about yeti.js. It was a complete mess, and it seemed like a bad conversion from the ruby version, plus we had no context because we didn't actually learn anything about JavaScript. I know it was supposed to be a lesson in debugging and being comfortable with error messages, but it just doesn't make sense. I will have to go back and look at it after I learn more about JavaScript.
