## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

- I am completely comfortable asking questions, and have no problem asking for help. I generally try to figure things out on my own, and then if I can't I ask for help, so I guess somewhere in between too soon and too long.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

- I feel fine about it, however most of the materials seemed to reiterated what was already stated in other provided materials. It felt redundant. Less support made me use things from my memory without reference a little bit, which is good, however most of it was still straightforward and laid out.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

- A conditional statement is a statement that has conditions attached to it. The condition is evaluated, and the output is calculated accordingly. If the condition is met, one thing happens, and if they are not met, a different thing happens. A real life example of this is if you make this amount of money, you are taxed this amount, if not, you are taxed a different amount. A conditional is probably used when a website asks you when you were born. If the current date minus your birthdate isn't equal to or greater than the website's age requirements, then you are denied. If it is greater than or equal to the age requirements, you are admitted.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

- You can add multiple conditions to an 'if' statement by adding other similar statements, but replacing 'if' with 'else if'. You can use as many 'else if' statements after the 'if' statement that you want, however the last statement must be an 'else' statement. The program read through all of the statements and evaluates if the conditions are true or false for the input information, and then it executes the true statement.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

- Logical operators are available to me as a developer. && between two conditions means that both conditions must be true in order for the interpreter to return the statement as true. || can be used for an OR statement, meaning both conditions must be false in order for the statement to return false.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

- How many lines is the longest 'if' statement you have ever written?
