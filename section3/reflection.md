## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

- Everything resonated with me in that article: Mistakes lead to learning, seeking help is a strength, practice leads to mastery, always be open to feedback, and there is always room to grow.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

- I already practice/believe all of the things in this article.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

- Youtube probably uses arrays on their playlists. Your history is lined up by which video you watched last, and if you watch a new one it is pushed to the front of the list, or I guess it might be the end of the list depending on how you think about it. Probably the end.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

- An array method is a method used to modify the elements within an array variable.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

- The purpose of a loop is to run the same block of code multiple times without having to type out that block of code multiple times. We would use a loop in conjunction with an array variable when we have a whole bunch of variables, and want to include data such as strings.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

- When you get in trouble in school, and your teacher makes you write "I will not be disruptive in class" 500 times, you have to do it manually. If you could program a loop, you would just have to write it 1 time, and then the program will write it the other 499 times.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

- I've been told that you don't want loops within loops, but I never asked why that was the case.
